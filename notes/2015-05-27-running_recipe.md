> It's 5:30AM, the sun rises, in headphones flies "A Song the World Can Sign Out Loud" by A [Change of Pace](https://play.google.com/music/preview/T7lhe3532pleyzeafrtp5o2xgv4?u=0#) and I run.

Best

experience

ever.

Now it's 6:30AM and I'm sitting in the front of my computer writing this (and finishing other one) blog post. I can't remember when the last time I could get into ["the Zone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29). I even suspected the burnout syndrome, but after today's running session I feel my brain refreshed.

I think I'll schedule my workouts to early hours permanently - and I recommend the same for You.
