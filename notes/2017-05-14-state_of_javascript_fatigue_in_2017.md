Is there any reason to keep complaining about JavaScript fatigue in 2017?

tldr;

No.

## This short article is my personal opinion about [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13849051) from HackerNews.

Reading through it I’ve seen repeating comments about current JavaScript fatigue or how messy js as a language is.

In my opinion the developers themselves are the cause of such state.

Everyone seems frustrated that they all have to use some weird multi-level abstraction tools to deal with web front-end development.

But the truth is that they don’t have to.

They don’t have to use webpack and Babel.

They don’t have to write code in ES6+.

They don’t have to use Vue.js / React.js / Angular.js / Backbone.js / Ember.js.

They don’t have to use CSS modules or PostCSS (or any other fancy/weird CSS-related stuff).

But they should always choose best tool for the job — and trust me — very often stuff above won’t be necessary.

5 years ago there were also rich web applications (a.k.a. today’s SPAs), but they wasn’t built on top of such monolith tools.

In almost every projects that I had pleasure to work with as a freelancer, there was just jQuery and couple other js plugins as a main stack. And codebase of these apps is maintanable and still clear today.

Additionaly, after speaking with couple fellow front-end developers I’ve found a pattern, that most of those who complain most about classic approach of front-end development are unable to design proper app architecture by themselves — they need clear frames HOW-TO build something — which is very often provided by X or Y framework guides.

So don’t be harsh to yourself  —  if You don’t want to work with React / Webpack / Babel / shinyFancyHypedFrameworkOrToolNameHere — just don’t use it.
