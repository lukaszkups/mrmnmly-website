> Last couple months were pretty busy and exhausting for me - mostly because of my bad logistic decisions and keeping generally good attitude for other people's sake.

Recently a lot going on in my life - I've become a father, moved to a new flat, accepted and done some extra work, tried (and keep trying) develop own side-projects etc. All that stuff gave me a lot of satisfaction but also it reflected badly on my health: I was constantly sleepy, gained weight and got in overall worse condition than usual.

In this (pretty long) note I would like to share couple life hacks that can improve everyone's life (or it just works for me tee-hee ;))

##Learn to say 'no'

Why it is so hard to decline additional, interesting and well paid job? Well, probably because we like to do interesting and well paid jobs. Personally, I've thought that if I refuse doing something for someone, then I'll be perceived as unprofessional or like someone who despises job offers.

The result of this kind of actions was overwork, overstrain and lack of time for family & myself. I've noticed also loss of productivity in my full-time job. I've realized that all this mess was caused because I wanted to make everyone happy and do all the tasks that I was receiving.

Don't try to repeat that (I won't, definitely)

In the end it goes so that we are crushed by the work and most things we do will be relatively poor quality - so it goes even worse for us and our clients. And don't forget that (bad) reputation about Your (bad) work will escalate quickly through the market.

##Do what You love to do (a.k.a. hack Your brain)

Probably you heard the above phrase a thousand times in motivation articles, but I wanted to mention a little different advice than simply doing what You love to do.

It is nearly impossible to do only the stuff that makes us happy - for example as a freelancer I really, really hated tax day (and the fact that tax law in Poland is really sick doesn't help)

Do thing that gives You (or WILL give You) a lot of satisfaction. For me, successfully filled and processed tax documents were a reason to be a little proud of (I was doing all the tax stuff by myself). It can sound a little silly, but sometimes we need to compel ourselves to think that something will give us satisfaction even if we don't know that. I was surprised how I've convinced my brain to do something because it was artificially interesting for me and in the end I feel a kind of satisfaction doing it.

##Don't analyze with emotions (too often) - compile just facts

Emotions can be really annoying when we have to make some serious decisions - nervousness, excitement, jitters, restlessness - You name it. This can be tricky or hard at the beginning, but the sooner You realize that emotions can really bother You from making right decisions the better person You will be.

Remember: work is just a work, task is just a task - it is not Your beloved girlfriend or boyfriend, it is not a person You want to hang out with for the rest of Your life - You just want to do it right. So analyze all the facts You have (about the problem) and then depend on them while making Your plan/decisions - no emotions, just simple, raw analysis.

This is really handy when someone ask You for advice - I have a friend who always analyze other people's actions and search for second meaning of it - he sometimes asks me for opinion if he understood someone correctly. Generally I'm asking him about the whole situation and giving answers basing only on everything he tell me (but not on his conjectures).

It is also helpful for solving arguments - very often people argue emotionally - try to face them as a devoid of emotions person and You will see how illogical they can be - You will see everything more clear and straight.

## Try to be honest first, not gentle (but don't be an asshole)

Just try. Sometimes You will risk of ridicule yourself or someone but after some time, You'll see that people will appreciate You for that.

## Don't waste Your time & money on personal / life coaches

Just don't. All You need to know is to stop giving a f*ck, and start doing what You have/want to do. Don't waste time on thinking if You are good enough to do something - start doing it instead. There is no time to loose, and remember that everyone is unique - someone do it faster/better, but all You have to do is just to start.

You (maybe) will fail - sometimes really painfully. But don't be afraid. Finally, after some time You will success.

Practice makes perfect - if You say otherwise then You probably never wanted to do something hard enough.
