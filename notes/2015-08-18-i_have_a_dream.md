## I have a dream about perfect company,

where all employees can work from wherever they want,

and they can prioritize their tasks however they want,

(as long as they'll ship them before the deadline)

where boss have confidence in their employees,

and not interfere in their private lives or plans.

## I have a dream about perfect colleagues,

who help each other if necessary,

who can admit their mistakes,

who are able to listen and to give advise.

## I have a dream about perfect clients,

which values quality first - not speed,

who trusts their contractors and their experience,

who appreciates beautiful design - not their sketched ideas.

## I have a dream about perfect country,

where sun always shines,

people are kind to each other,

and tax law doesn't want to screw you at every corner,

where people have real impact on the politics,

and courts really upholds law and order.

## I have a dream about perfect world,

where people always smiles,

and everyone are equal,

where people are filled with love and tolerance,

and there is no war.
