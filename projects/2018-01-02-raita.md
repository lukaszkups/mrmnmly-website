## Raita (*writer*, jap. ライター) is a static site generator with web interface. Made with Vue.js, Node.js and tons of love <3

This is my 2nd iteration of developing such product. Earlier version was made solely with Express.js and it was based on synchronous code. 

During this development iteration I've decided to use Vue.js (which I sincerely love) and (again) Express.js, but this time make it as asynchronous-based as possible. 

In my opinion, it went pretty well, but it's still a pretty long road till 1.0.0 (I've marked current version as 0.0.1) - I'm constantly adding new features and fixing annoying bugs.

## Roadmap

While I'm writing this project description (02/01/2018) I've planned to build my personal website with it (actually, You're seeing it now), then prepare starter theme and dedicated website for this project.

If You have any suggestions or You want to see the actual code, feel free to visit [Raita's official repo](http://github.com/mrmnmly/raita).
