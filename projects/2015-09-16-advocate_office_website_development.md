My task was to create the website, based on photoshop documents, prepared by graphic designer and accepted by the client.

I've also setup a blog section, powered by Wordpress CMS.

Technologies used in this project: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and some PHP code for Wordpress theme customization.
