WTP is the leading company in Greater Poland that specializes in cleaning lacquered steel surfaces.

My task was to create website based on provided Photoshop files provided by graphic designer and accepted by client. 

To complete this task I had to create couple custom JavaScript plugins (e.g. [before/after slider](http://wtp.net.pl/nasze-realizacje.html)) and add SEO optimization provided by 3rd party company.

This website was created with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript / jQuery and a bit of PHP code.
